# Training Scripts

This directory contains an assortment of scripts which are meant to simplify the
process of training a new model for object detection. There are scripts to
preprocess, annotate, and convert data, as well as scripts to visualize trained
models. The `experimental` subdirectory contains a few other scripts for one-off
tasks, as well as other implementations and experiments. Make sure to use the
`--help` command line options for all scripts mentioned, and to check the source
code if the tips don't make sense. Then, post an issue or a pull request to get
it fixed!
